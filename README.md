> What is this ?

Its an install script for my window manager rice. 

> Why did you make it ?

I frequently find myself having to re-install my window manager rice.
I intend this to be a solution to that problem.

# usage

run ``./script-main`` to start the script.

it installs all the required dependencies, so you don't need to worry about them.

if you are running it in a vm be sure to install the ``xf86-video-vmware`` package.
